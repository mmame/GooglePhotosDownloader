# GooglePhotosDownloader
Downloads all Photos from given Google account to a local directory

In 2019, Google decided to remove the possibility to sync Google Photos with Google Drive. 
There exist several cloud solutions which aim to fill that gap. But the solutions I tried are either not free or incredibly slow.

So I created this tiny utility to download all Google Photos to a local directory - which of course could refer to a folder synced with Google Drive  ;-)
